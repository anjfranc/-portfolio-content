	<p>In Kerala, Men often wear the traditional clothing item called mundu (pronounced muhn-duh). 
        The mundu is a piece of cloth that is often white and is wrapped around males’ waists. 
        The border of the mundu is often decorated with embroidery or colors.
        Often, men in Kerala wear a regular button up shirt or button-up t-shirt with the mundu. 

        However, in casual settings such as in houses or when doing labor work, men wear a garment around their waists called lungis (pronounced loon-gees) which are similar to mundus, but are more comfortable, casual, and are usually more colorful with patterns.
        
        In special settings and celebrations, women in Kerala wear an attire known as mundum neriyatum (pronounced muhn-duh neh-ree-ah-tuhm). 
        This is a set of two mundus with a lower garment around one’s waist like men wear and an upper mundu which is wrapped around one’s upper body and left hanging from a shoulder. 
        Women wear this upper mundu with a blouse. 
        It should be noted that western culture has greatly influences the fashions tyles in Kerala. 
        As a result, both women and men also often wear jeans, t- shirts, and casual blouses in non-festive settings.
